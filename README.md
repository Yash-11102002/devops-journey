# DevOps Journey ðŸš€  
This repo contains my 30-day DevOps + AWS + Cloud learning journey with projects in C#, Python, YAML, and CI/CD.

## Day 2 - Git Config and Branching

- Learned how to check current git user using `git config user.name` and `git config user.email`
- Changed Git config to use new account: `yashjob22@gmail.com`
- Created feature branch `feature/readme-day2` for adding updates
- Practiced branching workflow (main/dev â†’ feature â†’ PR â†’ merge)
